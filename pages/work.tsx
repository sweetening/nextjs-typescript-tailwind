            primarily work with React + Typescript, Next.js, Redux,
            Commercetools, Amplience, Javascript, CSS Modules, Freemarker, plus

            implementing features, replacing legacy code, fixing bugs, improving
            accessibility, and QA testing. Currently we are focusing on moving
            our legacy CMS to Amplience, and rebuilding our checkout system with
            Commercetools.
