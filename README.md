# 👋🏼 Hey, I'm Sanja, and this is my first project using Next.js & TailwindCSS

## I got the idea since a new project that my team will soon be taking over uses Tailwind, and honestly I was just curious about Next.js so I combined the project. This is my November 2021 Hacking Days project at Spreadshirt. The tutorial I used to setup the project is by @telmogoncalves, layout was adapted from tailwind-kit.com, and the rest I learned from reading the documentation
